# iOS Wallet Demo App

A demonstration iOS application showcasing advanced iOS development concepts including concurrency, memory management, and algorithmic thinking.

Built as interview preparation for iOS engineering positions.

## üéØ Purpose

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- **Concurrency & Multi-threading**
  - Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)
  - Modern Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors)
  - Task Groups for concurrent operations
  - Thread-safe data structures

- **Memory Management**
  - Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
  - Actor-based thread safety
  - LRU Cache with O(1) operations
  - Proper weak/unowned reference usage
  - Value types vs Reference types

- **Common Algorithms & Data Structures**
  - Binary Search (O(log n))
  - Quick Sort & Merge Sort (O(n log n))
  - LRU Cache (doubly-linked list + hash map)
  - Two Pointer technique
  - Sliding Window algorithm
  - Hash-based lookups and filtering

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components

- **Models**: `Pass`, `Transaction` - Value types for data integrity
- **DataManager**: `@MainActor` class handling async operations
- **LRUCache**: Thread-safe actor with O(1) get/put operations
- **AlgorithmUtils**: Implementations of common CS algorithms
- **TransactionProcessor**: Sorting, filtering, and aggregation logic

### Concurrency Patterns

```swift
// Actor for thread safety
actor LRUCache<Key: Hashable, Value> {
    // Automatically thread-safe
}

// Task Groups for concurrent fetching
try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: [Transaction].self) { group in
    for passId in passIds {
        group.addTask {
            try await fetchTransactions(for: passId)
        }
    }
}

// @MainActor for UI updates
@MainActor
class DataManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var passes: [Pass] = []
}
```

### Memory Management

- Actor-based synchronization prevents data races
- Weak delegate references prevent retain cycles
- Value types (structs) for models avoid reference counting overhead
- Bounded LRU cache prevents unbounded memory growth

## üöÄ Features

- **Pass Management**: Display and manage multiple wallet passes
- **Transaction History**: View and filter transaction records
- **Concurrent Data Loading**: Fetch multiple resources simultaneously
- **Smart Caching**: Multi-layer caching with LRU eviction
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time search with multiple sort options
- **Statistics**: Aggregate transaction data with category analysis

## üìä Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Cache Get | O(1) | O(capacity) |
| Cache Put | O(1) | O(capacity) |
| Binary Search | O(log n) | O(1) |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) avg | O(log n) |
| Transaction Filter | O(n) | O(n) |
| Stats Calculation | O(n) | O(categories) |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Concurrency**: Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with reactive bindings
- **Minimum iOS**: 16.0+

## üèÉ Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wallet-demo.git
cd wallet-demo
```

2. Open in Xcode:
```bash
open WalletDemo.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run (‚åòR) on iOS Simulator or device

**Requirements:**
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 16.0+ deployment target
- macOS 13.0+ (for development)

## üß™ Testing Approach

The app includes comprehensive demonstrations of:

- Thread-safe concurrent operations
- Memory management best practices
- Algorithm implementations with known complexity
- Cache behavior monitoring (check console logs)

### What to Look For

- Console logs showing cache hits/misses
- Concurrent fetch operations completing simultaneously
- Proper deallocation (no memory leaks)
- Smooth UI performance during data operations

## üìö Learning Resources

This project implements concepts from:

- [Apple's Concurrency Documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html)
- [Swift Evolution Proposals](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution)
- Classic algorithms and data structures
